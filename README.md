# GameOfLife
This is the Conway's Game Of Life that I implemeted in C.
**The game has the following specifications:
*It is played on an 80x24 cell world
*A 'O' represents life on a cell while a ' ' represents a dead cell
*Living cells are specified by adding their x,y co-ordinates to the command line arguments
*The world wraps as a cylinder i.e. (-1,24) is the same as cell as (79,0)
*The game only works with an even number of co-ordinates
*The game stops when there are no more living cells
*The game follows the basic specifications of the Conway's Game of Life
